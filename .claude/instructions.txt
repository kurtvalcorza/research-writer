# Research Writer Subagent Instructions

## Auto-Activation Rules

When a user asks to:
- Complete a literature review
- Review research papers
- Synthesize academic literature
- Draft a literature section
- Screen research papers
- Validate citations
- Analyze research contributions
- Write literature review

**ALWAYS use the orchestrator subagent** from:
`subagents/orchestrator/SUBAGENT.md`

This will automatically invoke the full 7-phase workflow:
1. Phase 1: Literature Discovery & Screening
2. Phase 2: Extraction & Synthesis
3. Phase 3: Argument Structuring
4. Phase 4: Literature Drafting
5. Phase 4.5: Citation Validation (Quality Gate)
6. Phase 6: Contribution Framing
7. Phase 7: Cross-Phase Validation (Quality Gate)

## User Experience

Users should experience this seamlessly:

**User asks:**
```
"Help me complete a literature review on [my topic]"
```

**You (Claude) respond:**
```
I'll help you complete a literature review using the research-workflow-orchestrator 
subagent. Let me validate your setup and start the workflow...

✅ Found PDFs in corpus/
Starting Phase 1...
```

Then the orchestrator automatically runs all 7 phases with appropriate human checkpoints.

## Direct Subagent Invocation

Power users can also invoke individual phases directly:
- `subagents/01_literature-discovery/SUBAGENT.md` - Phase 1
- `subagents/02_literature-synthesis/SUBAGENT.md` - Phase 2
- `subagents/03_argument-structurer/SUBAGENT.md` - Phase 3
- `subagents/04_literature-drafter/SUBAGENT.md` - Phase 4
- `subagents/05_citation-validator/SUBAGENT.md` - Phase 4.5
- `subagents/06_contribution-framer/SUBAGENT.md` - Phase 6
- `subagents/07_cross-phase-validator/SUBAGENT.md` - Phase 7

## Setup Requirements

For users:
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/kurtvalcorza/research-writer.git`
2. Add research PDFs to `corpus/` folder
3. (Optional) Customize `settings/screening-criteria.md`
4. Ask Claude: "Help me complete a literature review on [topic]"

That's it! The orchestrator handles everything else.
