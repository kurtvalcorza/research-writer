## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: CUSTOMIZE THIS TEMPLATE BEFORE USE

**This file contains EXAMPLE content for demonstration purposes.**

The current content is customized for a study on "AI adoption in the Philippines" and serves as a reference example.

**YOU MUST:**
1. Replace the research topic with your own
2. Customize inclusion/exclusion criteria for your study
3. Update geographic and temporal scope
4. Modify example applications to match your context

**DO NOT use this template as-is.** The screening criteria must match your specific research question.

- Regional studies (e.g., "Southeast Asia") that do not include Philippines or provide Philippines-specific data
- Global studies that do not disaggregate findings by country or mention Philippines

---

### 4. Temporal Exclusions
**Excluded if:**
[x] Published before 2023
[ ] Published after 2025

---

### 5. Language Exclusions
**Excluded if:**
Papers not in English (unless Filipino/Tagalog papers with translation resources available)

---

### 6. Duplicate or Overlapping Publications
- [ ] Exclude duplicate publications of the same study
- [ ] If multiple publications from same dataset, select the most comprehensive

---

### 7. Quality Thresholds
- [ ] Retracted publications
- [ ] Known predatory journals (check DOAJ, Beall's List, etc.)
- [ ] Insufficient methodological rigor (to be assessed during full-text review)

---

### 8. Other Domain-Specific Exclusions

---

## Edge Cases and Decision Rules

### Borderline Cases
**If a paper is borderline relevant:**
[ ] Include and flag for closer review
[ ] Exclude conservatively
[ ] Mark as UNCERTAIN for human review

**Preferred approach:** Mark as UNCERTAIN for human decision

---

### Missing Information
**If publication year is unclear:**
Mark as METADATA_INSUFFICIENT; attempt to verify from source or DOI lookup

**If geographic context is ambiguous:**
Include if potentially relevant (mentions "Southeast Asia", "ASEAN", "developing countries"); flag for full-text verification to confirm Philippines inclusion

---

### Conflicting Criteria
**If a paper meets some inclusion criteria but also an exclusion criterion:**
[Decision rule, e.g., "Exclusion criteria take precedence unless marked as UNCERTAIN"]

---

## Screening Protocol

### Title/Abstract Screening
**Decision based on:**
- Paper title clearly indicates relevance
- Abstract (if available) describes scope, methodology, and findings
- Metadata (year, authors, journal) confirms eligibility

**Liberal vs. Conservative approach:**
Liberal - include unless clearly irrelevant

**Recommended:** Liberal at title/abstract stage (to avoid missing relevant Philippines studies); conservative at full-text stage

---

### Full-Text Screening (if applicable in later workflow)
**Decision based on:**
- Complete methodology section review
- Verification of geographic/temporal scope
- Quality assessment of empirical evidence

---

## Quality Control

**Consistency checks:**
- [ ] Apply criteria uniformly across all papers
- [ ] Document rationale for all UNCERTAIN classifications
- [ ] Flag systematic patterns (e.g., if many papers fall into UNCERTAIN, criteria may need refinement)

**Human review triggers:**
- Papers marked UNCERTAIN
- Papers with conflicting metadata
- First 10-20 papers screened (to validate criteria application)

---

## Example Application

### Example 1: INCLUDE

**Paper:** "AI Adoption Challenges in Philippine SMEs: A Survey Study" (2024)

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Topic: AI adoption (relevant)
- ✅ Methodology: Empirical survey (acceptable)
- ✅ Geographic: Philippines (target region)
- ✅ Date: 2024 (within range)
- ✅ Language: English

**Decision:** INCLUDE

---

### Example 2: EXCLUDE

**Paper:** "Deep Learning Optimization for Image Recognition Tasks" (2023)

**Assessment:**
- ❌ Topic: Pure algorithm development, no adoption/implementation context
- ❌ Scope: Technical only, no organizational or policy discussion
- ❌ Geographic: No specific country focus

**Decision:** EXCLUDE (Reason: Purely technical, out of scope - no adoption context)

---

### Example 3: UNCERTAIN

**Paper:** "Digital Transformation Strategies in ASEAN Manufacturing Sector" (2022)

**Assessment:**
- ⚠️ Topic: Digital transformation mentioned, but unclear if AI adoption is substantively discussed
- ⚠️ Geographic: "ASEAN" includes Philippines, but unclear if Philippines-specific data provided
- ✅ Date: 2022 (acceptable)
- ✅ Publication: Peer-reviewed journal

**Decision:** UNCERTAIN (Flag: Verify if AI adoption is substantively discussed; confirm if Philippines is included with disaggregated data)

---

### Example 4: METADATA_INSUFFICIENT

**Paper:** File "scan_document_2023.pdf"

**Assessment:**
- ❌ Metadata: No extractable title, author, or abstract
- ❌ Quality: Appears to be scanned image without OCR

**Decision:** METADATA_INSUFFICIENT (Action: Requires OCR or manual metadata entry)

---

## Notes for Agent

When applying these criteria:
1. **Be consistent:** Apply the same interpretation across all papers
2. **Be transparent:** Document specific criteria that led to each decision
3. **Be conservative with automation:** When uncertain, flag for human review
4. **Be explicit about limitations:** Note when metadata extraction affects screening quality

---

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing screening:
- [ ] All inclusion criteria are clear and operationalizable
- [ ] All exclusion criteria are clear and operationalizable
- [ ] Edge case decision rules are defined
- [ ] Example applications are provided for common scenarios
- [ ] Agent understands when to use UNCERTAIN vs. INCLUDE/EXCLUDE
