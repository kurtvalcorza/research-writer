# Example Outputs

This directory contains sample outputs from running the research writing workflow on a small 3-paper corpus about AI adoption in the Philippines.

## About the Example Corpus

The examples are based on screening and analyzing 3 research papers:
1. Pareja (2025) - AI adoption barriers study
2. Campued et al. (2023) - Digital transformation framework
3. Jala et al. (2024) - AI readiness assessment

These examples demonstrate the expected format and quality of outputs at each phase.

## Example Files

### Phase 1: Literature Discovery & Screening
- `literature-screening-matrix-example.md` - Screening recommendations for 3 papers
- Shows INCLUDE/EXCLUDE recommendations with rationales
- Demonstrates PRISMA-compliant documentation

### Phase 2: Literature Extraction & Synthesis
- `literature-extraction-matrix-example.md` - Paper-by-paper extraction (3 rows)
- `literature-synthesis-matrix-example.md` - Theme-centric synthesis (5 themes)
- Shows PDF processing quality report (EXCELLENT - 100% success rate)

### Phase 3: Argument Structure & Review Outline
- `literature-review-outline-example.md` - Structured outline with 6 sections
- Demonstrates evidence strength labels and argument flow

### Phase 4: Literature Review Drafting
- `literature-review-draft-example.md` - Theme-driven academic prose (not paper-by-paper)
- Shows proper citation usage and hedging language

### Phase 4.5: Citation Integrity Validation
- `citation-integrity-report-example.md` - Quality control validation report
- Shows PASS status (zero fabricated citations, balanced distribution)

### Phase 6: Contribution & Implications Framing
- `research-contributions-implications-example.md` - Grounded contribution claims
- Demonstrates proportional implications and limitations

### Phase 7: Cross-Phase Validation
- `cross-phase-validation-report-example.md` - Consistency score: 92/100
- Shows complete traceability and phase alignment

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Before running each phase:** Review the corresponding example to understand expected format
2. **After running each phase:** Compare your output to the example for quality check
3. **If outputs don't match:** Review the SKILL.md file for detailed specifications

## Note

These are simplified examples for demonstration. Real-world outputs will be longer and more detailed, especially for larger corpora (10+ papers).

The examples focus on STRUCTURE and FORMAT rather than perfect academic content.
