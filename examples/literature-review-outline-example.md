## Literature Review Outline

### Section 1: Current State of AI Adoption in the Philippines

**Core Claim:** The Philippines finds itself in the foundational stage of AI adoption, characterized by low overall readiness and limited organizational awareness of AI potential, particularly among small and medium enterprises.

**Evidence Profile:** Strong consensus (all 3 papers)

**Key Themes Covered:**
- AI Readiness and Awareness
- Baseline adoption status
- Organizational awareness levels

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Jala et al. (2024): Quantitative readiness score 45/100
- Pareja (2025): Early-stage adoption documented across sectors
- Campued et al. (2023): SMEs at basic digitization level

**Evidence Strength:** Strong - all papers converge on foundational/early-stage characterization

### Section 2: Infrastructure and Technical Prerequisites

**Core Claim:** Infrastructure deficits at multiple levels—spanning connectivity, data systems, and hardware/software capabilities—represent a fundamental material barrier to AI adoption, compounded by high implementation costs for resource-constrained organizations.

**Evidence Profile:** Strong consensus (all 3 papers, with varying emphasis)

**Key Themes Covered:**
- Infrastructure and Technical Prerequisites
- Cost barriers
- Multi-level infrastructure requirements

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Jala et al. (2024): Data infrastructure gaps (score: 40/100)
- Pareja (2025): Infrastructure limitations + cost barriers emphasized
- Campued et al. (2023): Infrastructure integrated in maturity framework

**Evidence Strength:** Strong - documented through multiple measurement approaches (quantitative + qualitative)

### Section 3: Critical Skills and Workforce Development Constraints

**Core Claim:** Critical skill gaps and shortage of AI professionals emerge as the most urgent constraint to AI adoption, with workforce development needs identified across technical capabilities, strategic planning, and organizational change management.

**Evidence Profile:** Strong consensus (all 3 papers)

**Key Themes Covered:**
- Skills and Workforce Development
- Professional shortage
- Training needs

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Jala et al. (2024): Skills score 35/100, documenting "significant skill gaps and shortage"
- Campued et al. (2023): "Need for tailored training" emphasized
- Pareja (2025): Limited technical skills identified as critical barrier

**Evidence Strength:** Very strong - unanimous agreement with both qualitative and quantitative support

### Section 4: AI Adoption as Digital Transformation Trajectory

**Core Claim:** AI adoption is best understood not as a standalone initiative but as part of a broader digital transformation journey, progressing through stages from basic digitization to data-driven AI integration.

**Evidence Profile:** Mixed (strong in Campued; implicit in others)

**Key Themes Covered:**
- Digital Transformation Context
- Maturity progression
- Staged adoption approaches

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Campued et al. (2023): Explicit 4-level maturity framework
- Pareja (2025), Jala et al. (2024): Implicit framing within digital transformation discourse

**Evidence Strength:** Moderate - well-articulated framework but limited empirical validation

### Section 5: Sector and Organizational Scale Heterogeneity

**Core Claim:** Barriers and readiness vary substantially by sector and organizational scale, with small and medium enterprises facing disproportionately higher adoption challenges compared to large corporations.

**Evidence Profile:** Emerging/limited (documented but not comprehensively)

**Key Themes Covered:**
- Sector-Specific Considerations
- SME vs. large enterprise divide
- Manufacturing sector specifics

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Pareja (2025): SMEs vs. large enterprise comparative barrier analysis
- Jala et al. (2024): Manufacturing sector-specific readiness assessment
- Campued et al. (2023): SME focus

**Evidence Strength:** Limited - patterns identified but sectoral coverage incomplete

### Section 6: Gaps in Current Research and Future Directions

**Core Claim:** While current literature establishes baseline adoption status and barriers, critical gaps remain in longitudinal perspectives, policy analysis, geographic coverage beyond Metro Manila, and documentation of successful implementation cases.

**Evidence Profile:** Sparse/absent (gaps identified through synthesis)

**Key Themes Covered:**
- Cross-cutting gaps from synthesis
- Research limitations
- Future research opportunities

**Evidence Strength:** N/A (gap identification, not empirical claims)

## Argument Flow Summary

**Progression Logic:**

The review follows a **descriptive → explanatory → contextual → forward-looking** structure:

1. **Section 1 (Current State):** Establishes baseline - where the Philippines currently stands in AI adoption.

2. **Sections 2-3 (Infrastructure + Skills):** Identifies material and human capital constraints explaining low adoption.

3. **Section 4 (Digital Transformation):** Provides conceptual framing - how to understand AI adoption as part of broader transformation.

4. **Section 5 (Heterogeneity):** Introduces boundary conditions - adoption varies by sector and scale.

5. **Section 6 (Gaps):** Acknowledges limitations and points toward future research directions.

**Rationale:** This structure moves from establishing context (what is happening) to explaining barriers (why adoption is limited) to framing solutions (how to conceptualize pathways forward) to acknowledging boundaries (where knowledge gaps remain).

## Consolidated Gaps & Tensions

### Major Unresolved Issues:
1. **Temporal dynamics unknown:** No longitudinal data on how firms progress through adoption stages
2. **Policy vacuum:** Regulatory environment and government AI strategy underexamined
3. **Geographic bias:** Heavy Metro Manila focus; rural/provincial adoption not addressed
4. **Missing success cases:** Focus on barriers > documentation of successful implementations

### Methodological Blind Spots:
- Cross-sectional designs limit causal inference
- Self-reported data may overestimate readiness (Jala)
- Limited sector coverage (BPO, healthcare, finance absent)
- Small sample sizes in qualitative studies

### Conceptual Tensions:
- None identified - papers are complementary rather than contradictory
- Different lenses (barriers, readiness, maturity) converge on similar conclusions
