## Synthesis Summary

| Theme / Analytical Dimension | Papers Addressing Theme | Consensus / Patterns | Contradictions / Divergence | Identified Gaps | Implications for Review |
|------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **AI Readiness and Awareness** | All 3 papers (Pareja, Campued, Jala) | Universal agreement that Philippines is in foundational/early stage of AI adoption. Low overall readiness scores (Jala: 45/100). Limited awareness of AI potential among SMEs. | Pareja focuses on barriers, Campued on maturity framework, Jala on quantitative readiness - different lenses but compatible findings. | Longitudinal data absent. No comparison with other ASEAN countries' AI readiness trajectories. | This theme establishes the current baseline. Critical foundation for understanding adoption barriers and pathways. |
| **Skills and Workforce Development** | All 3 papers (emphasis: Campued, Jala, implicit in Pareja) | Universal agreement on critical skill gaps as primary constraint. Shortage of AI professionals documented (Jala: 35/100 skills score). Need for tailored training emphasized (Campued). | Campued emphasizes training solutions, Jala documents severity of gaps, Pareja frames skills as barrier - complementary perspectives. | No studies on effective training models. Impact of skills interventions not measured. Role of universities/training institutions underexplored. | Skills emerge as the most urgent constraint across all three studies. Requires dedicated section in review. |
| **Infrastructure and Technical Prerequisites** | Pareja (strong), Jala (strong), Campued (moderate) | Consensus on infrastructure deficits: data infrastructure gaps (Jala: 40/100), connectivity issues, hardware/software limitations (Pareja). Multi-level infrastructure needs identified. | Pareja emphasizes cost barriers, Jala focuses on technical gaps, Campued integrates infrastructure in maturity framework. | Cloud vs. on-premise trade-offs not explored. Industry-specific infrastructure needs unclear. | Infrastructure represents multi-dimensional barrier (technical + financial). Links to SME vs. large enterprise divide. |
| **Digital Transformation Context** | Campued (primary), Pareja (implicit), Jala (background) | AI adoption conceptualized as part of broader digital transformation journey, not standalone. 4-level maturity progression documented (Campued). | Campued explicitly frameworks digital transformation; others imply it without explicit models. | How firms progress through maturity levels unclear. Time and resource requirements for each stage not documented. | Positions AI adoption within larger transformation narrative. Useful framing for understanding staged adoption approaches. |
| **Sector-Specific Considerations** | Jala (manufacturing focus), Pareja (cross-sector), Campued (SMEs) | Different sectors/firm sizes face different barriers. SMEs have higher barriers than large firms (Pareja). Manufacturing sector shows specific readiness challenges (Jala). | Limited sector comparisons. Each paper focuses on different segment. | Cross-sector comparisons missing. Healthcare, finance, government AI adoption not covered. BPO sector (major Philippine industry) absent. | Corpus reveals sector heterogeneity but lacks comprehensive sector coverage. Gap creates review boundary. |

## Cross-Cutting Gaps

1. **Longitudinal perspectives missing:** All studies are cross-sectional. No data on adoption trajectories over time.

2. **Limited policy analysis:** Regulatory environment mentioned (Pareja) but not substantively analyzed. Government AI strategy not examined.

3. **Geographic concentration:** Heavy Metro Manila / urban bias. Rural or provincial AI adoption not addressed.

4. **Success cases underrepresented:** Focus on barriers and challenges; limited documentation of successful AI implementations.

5. **Comparative ASEAN context sparse:** Only Campued provides regional perspective, and even that is limited.

## Thematic Coherence Assessment

**Corpus Coverage:** Adequate for scoping barriers, readiness, and initial adoption stages. Insufficient for advanced implementation, sector-specific deep-dives, or policy analysis.

**Complementarity:** Papers approach AI adoption from different angles (barriers, readiness, maturity framework) but converge on similar conclusions, particularly around skills and infrastructure.

**Evidence Strength:** Moderate to strong for barriers and readiness assessment. Weak for solutions, interventions, and longitudinal trends.

## Implications for Literature Review Structure

**Recommended section organization:**

1. **Current State of AI Adoption** (Theme: AI Readiness) - Foundation section establishing baseline
2. **Infrastructure Prerequisites** (Theme: Infrastructure) - Material/technical barriers
3. **Human Capital Constraints** (Theme: Skills) - Most urgent barrier, requires emphasis
4. **Digital Transformation Pathways** (Theme: DT Context) - Framing/conceptual section
5. **Sector and Scale Considerations** (Theme: Sector-Specific) - Heterogeneity and boundary conditions
6. **Gaps and Future Directions** - Synthesis of cross-cutting gaps

**Strength profile:**
- Strong consensus: Skills gaps, infrastructure deficits, early-stage adoption status
- Mixed/contested: None identified (papers are complementary, not contradictory)
- Emerging/limited: Digital transformation maturity progressions, sector differences
- Sparse/absent: Policy environment, longitudinal trends, success cases, non-Metro Manila contexts
