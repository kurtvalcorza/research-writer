# Literature Review Drafter (Phase 4)

This skill converts a **validated literature review outline (Phase 3)** and a **literature synthesis matrix (Phase 2)** into a **coherent, theme-driven literature review draft**.

This phase focuses on **controlled prose generation**, grounded strictly in prior analytical outputs.

---

## 1. Trigger
Activate this skill when the user:
- Has an approved literature review outline (Phase 3), and
- Requests a draft of the literature review section.

---

## 2. Pre-Execution Validation

**Before beginning drafting, validate prerequisites:**

### 2.1 Verify Required Input Files

**Required files:**
- `outputs/literature-review-outline.md` (generated by Phase 3)
- `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` (generated by Phase 2)

**Optional file:**
- `outputs/literature-extraction-matrix.md` (may be consulted for citation details)

**Validation steps:**
1. Check that `outputs/literature-review-outline.md` exists and is non-empty
2. Check that `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` exists and is non-empty
3. Verify outline contains section structure with core claims
4. Verify synthesis matrix contains themes and evidence

**If required files are missing:**
- **Outline missing:** Halt and prompt: "The outline file `outputs/literature-review-outline.md` was not found. Please complete Phase 3 (Argument Structuring) first."
- **Synthesis matrix missing:** Halt and prompt: "The synthesis matrix `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` was not found. Please complete Phase 2 (Literature Extraction & Synthesis) first."
- **Files empty:** Halt and prompt: "Required input files appear empty. Ensure Phases 2 and 3 completed successfully."

### 2.2 Prepare Output Directory
1. Verify `outputs/` directory exists (should exist from previous phases)
2. If missing, create `outputs/` directory
3. Check for existing `literature-review-draft.md` and note if updating or creating fresh

### 2.3 Verify Phase Dependencies
1. Confirm both Phase 2 and Phase 3 outputs are present
2. Check outline references themes that exist in synthesis matrix
3. If mismatch detected, warn: "Outline references themes not found in synthesis matrix. Draft quality may be affected."

---

## 3. Objective
Produce a **structured literature review draft** that:
- Is organized by themes, not individual papers
- Accurately reflects consensus, debate, and gaps
- Maintains traceability to the synthesis matrix
- Uses formal academic tone and neutral language

---

## 4. Inputs
- `outputs/literature-review-outline.md` (from Phase 3)
- `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` (from Phase 2)

No additional sources may be introduced.

---

## 5. Execution Model

This skill operates as a **section-by-section drafting workflow**:

### 5.1 Processing Strategy

**Section-by-Section Generation:**
- Read outline to identify all sections
- Read synthesis matrix into context (holistic view of evidence)
- Draft each section sequentially, one at a time
- Write each completed section to output file incrementally

**Memory Management:**
- Load outline and synthesis matrix at start
- Process sections sequentially to maintain coherence
- Suitable for outlines with 3-10 sections (typical output from Phase 3)
- Each section drafted independently but with awareness of overall narrative flow

**State Management:**
- Track progress via internal section counter
- If interrupted mid-section, restart that section (sections are ~200-400 words, low restart cost)
- Completed sections are saved incrementally to `outputs/literature-review-draft.md`

### 5.2 Evidence Density Guidelines

**Adapting paragraph length to evidence:**

- **High density (10+ papers on theme):** 2-3 paragraphs
  - Paragraph 1: Consensus view with multiple citations
  - Paragraph 2: Divergent findings or methodological variations
  - Paragraph 3: Gaps or limitations (if applicable)

- **Moderate density (5-9 papers):** 1-2 paragraphs
  - Paragraph 1: Main findings with representative citations
  - Paragraph 2: Gaps or contrasts (if present)

- **Low density (2-4 papers):** 1 paragraph
  - Concise synthesis with all relevant citations
  - Acknowledge limited evidence base

- **Minimal evidence (1 paper):** Brief mention
  - Single sentence or incorporated into adjacent theme
  - Explicitly note "limited evidence"

### 5.3 Dependency Chain

**Sequential dependency:**
1. Phase 2 (synthesis matrix) must be complete
2. Phase 3 (outline) must be complete
3. This phase produces draft for human review and refinement

**Quality propagation:**
- Draft quality depends on outline structure and synthesis quality
- Weak synthesis → sparse evidence integration
- Unclear outline claims → unfocused paragraphs
- Agent cannot create evidence that doesn't exist in synthesis matrix

---

## 6. Execution Steps

### 6.1 Section-by-Section Drafting
For each section in the outline:
- Use the **Core Claim** as the paragraph anchor
- Integrate evidence from multiple papers per theme
- Avoid sequential or paper-by-paper narration

**Paragraph structure:**
- Follow evidence density guidelines in Section 5.2
- Adapt length based on theme complexity and paper count

---

### 6.2 Evidence Integration Rules
- Cite multiple studies when describing consensus
- Explicitly signal disagreement or divergence where present
- Attribute findings accurately and conservatively
- Use hedging language when evidence is limited or mixed

---

### 6.3 Gap Signposting
Where gaps are identified:
- Clearly indicate what is missing or underexplored
- Avoid speculative explanations
- Defer implications to later sections unless explicitly requested

---

### 6.4 Citation Handling

**Default citation style: ACM (Association for Computing Machinery)**
- In-text format: `Author(s) Year` or `(Author(s) Year)`
- Example: "Smith 2023 found..." or "Recent studies (Smith 2023, Jones 2024) demonstrate..."
- For multiple authors: "Smith et al. 2023"

**Citation alignment:**
- Match citation format from extraction matrix where available
- If extraction matrix uses different style (APA, MLA, Chicago), follow that format
- Maintain consistency throughout the draft

**Handling incomplete metadata:**
- Do not fabricate bibliographic details
- Use minimal identifiers if full citation unavailable: `(Study X, approx. 2023)`
- Flag incomplete citations in output for human review

**Citation frequency:**
- Cite multiple studies for consensus claims: `(Author1 2023, Author2 2024, Author3 2024)`
- Attribute specific findings to specific papers
- Avoid over-citation (not every sentence needs a citation)

---

## 7. Output Structure

Save the result as: `outputs/literature-review-draft.md`

The output must include:
- Clear section headings aligned with the outline
- Coherent, theme-driven paragraphs
- Explicit transitions between sections
- Proper in-text citations (ACM style by default)
- Academic tone throughout

# Literature Review

## Theoretical Foundations of AI Adoption

The literature establishes three dominant theoretical frameworks as primary lenses for understanding AI adoption in organizational contexts. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) emphasizes perceived usefulness and ease of use as key determinants (Davis 1989, Venkatesh and Bala 2008), while Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory highlights the role of innovation characteristics and social systems in adoption decisions (Rogers 2003, Tornatzky and Klein 1982). The Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework extends these perspectives by explicitly incorporating organizational readiness and environmental pressures (Baker 2012, Oliveira and Martins 2011). Recent comparative studies demonstrate that these frameworks are complementary rather than competing, with TAM addressing individual-level adoption, DOI explaining diffusion patterns, and TOE capturing organizational context (Chen et al. 2023, Williams and Lee 2024, Park 2024).

Despite this theoretical convergence, empirical operationalization remains inconsistent. Multiple studies note significant variation in how "organizational readiness" is measured across TOE applications (Martinez 2023, Singh et al. 2024), limiting cross-study comparability. Similarly, the integration of ethical considerations into these traditional frameworks remains largely absent, with only three studies explicitly addressing ethical implications of AI adoption (Kumar 2024, Thompson 2024, Zhang 2023).

## Empirical Evidence on Adoption Drivers

Empirical studies consistently identify perceived usefulness and organizational culture as primary drivers of AI adoption, though measurement approaches vary significantly across contexts. Survey-based research in North American firms (n=450) found perceived usefulness to be the strongest predictor of adoption intent (β=0.68, p<0.001), followed by top management support (β=0.52, p<0.01) and organizational culture openness (β=0.47, p<0.01) (Williams and Lee 2024). Similar patterns emerge in European contexts (Martinez 2023, Schmidt et al. 2023), suggesting cross-cultural consistency in these drivers.

However, methodological differences complicate synthesis. While Williams and Lee 2024 employed structural equation modeling with validated scales, other studies used custom instruments with limited psychometric reporting (Chen et al. 2023, Park 2024). This measurement inconsistency raises questions about whether observed variations reflect true contextual differences or methodological artifacts.

## Barriers and Resistance Patterns

[Continue with additional sections...]
```

---

## 8. Constraints
- Do not introduce new concepts, theories, or sources
- Do not summarize papers individually
- Do not overstate findings beyond the synthesis
- Do not include conclusions or recommendations unless requested
- Avoid rhetorical or persuasive language

---

## 9. Error Handling

### 9.1 Missing or Invalid Input Files

**If outline file is missing or empty:**
- Halt execution
- Prompt: "Required outline file `outputs/literature-review-outline.md` not found or empty. Please complete Phase 3 first."

**If synthesis matrix is missing or empty:**
- Halt execution
- Prompt: "Required synthesis matrix `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` not found or empty. Please complete Phase 2 first."

**If outline structure is malformed:**
- Attempt best-effort parsing
- Flag sections that couldn't be processed
- Warn: "Outline structure appears incomplete. Draft may have gaps."

### 9.2 Insufficient Evidence for Sections

**If outline section lacks corresponding themes in synthesis matrix:**
- Flag in draft: `[EVIDENCE GAP: Theme "[theme name]" not found in synthesis matrix]`
- Draft brief placeholder paragraph noting limited evidence
- Recommend user review Phase 3 outline alignment with Phase 2 synthesis

**If theme has <2 papers:**
- Draft brief treatment (1-2 sentences)
- Explicitly note: "Evidence on this theme is limited, with only [N] study addressing it."
- Continue with available evidence

### 9.3 Citation Extraction Failures

**If synthesis matrix lacks citation details:**
- Use placeholder: `(Author Unknown, Year Unknown)` with flag
- Note in output metadata: "X citations require manual verification"
- Recommend consulting extraction matrix for complete citation details

**If author names or years are ambiguous:**
- Use best available information
- Flag ambiguous citations: `(Smith [tentative], 2023)`
- Document uncertainty for human review

### 9.4 Output Write Failures

**If unable to write to `outputs/` directory:**
- Halt and report: "Cannot write to `outputs/` directory. Verify write permissions."
- Offer to return draft in response text as fallback

**If partial draft exists and process interrupted:**
- Resume from last completed section
- Note in output: "Draft resumed from Section [N]"

### 9.5 Quality and Tone Issues

**Self-check after drafting each section:**
- Verify no paper-by-paper narration (theme-driven only)
- Check for unsupported claims (all claims traceable to synthesis matrix)
- Ensure academic tone (no persuasive or normative language)
- Confirm citations are present and properly formatted

**If quality issues detected:**
- Flag problematic sections: `[REVIEW NEEDED: Possible paper-by-paper narration in paragraph X]`
- Provide diagnostic notes for human review

## 12. Integration with Other Phases

### 12.1 Relationship to Phase 2 (Literature Extraction & Synthesis)

**Prerequisites from Phase 2:**
- `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` must exist with theme analysis
- Synthesis matrix should include evidence patterns, consensus, divergence, and gaps
- Citation details should be available (either in synthesis or extraction matrix)

**Quality Dependency:**
- Draft quality directly depends on synthesis quality
- Sparse synthesis → thin paragraphs with limited evidence
- Missing theme analysis → difficulty constructing coherent narrative

**Usage pattern:**
- Synthesis matrix provides evidence base for all claims
- Extraction matrix may be consulted for detailed citation information
- Agent cannot create evidence not present in matrices

### 12.2 Relationship to Phase 3 (Argument Structuring)

**Prerequisites from Phase 3:**
- `outputs/literature-review-outline.md` must exist with section structure
- Outline should include core claims, evidence profiles, and key themes for each section
- Section sequence should be logically justified

**Quality Dependency:**
- Draft structure directly mirrors outline structure
- Weak or unclear core claims → unfocused paragraphs
- Missing evidence profiles → difficulty calibrating tone and hedging

**Usage pattern:**
- Each outline section becomes a review section
- Core claims guide paragraph topic sentences
- Evidence profiles inform citation density and hedging language

### 12.3 Workflow Continuity

**Complete pipeline:**
1. Phase 1: Screen corpus → approved PDFs in `corpus/`
2. Phase 2: Extract & synthesize → matrices in `outputs/`
3. Phase 3: Structure argument → outline in `outputs/`
4. **Phase 4: Draft review → literature review draft in `outputs/`**

**Post-Phase 4 workflow:**
- Human review and revision of draft
- Integration into larger document (introduction, methods, discussion)
- Citation list generation (currently manual)
- Final formatting and submission

**Note:** Phase 4 produces a draft requiring human review and refinement. It is not a final, publication-ready document.
