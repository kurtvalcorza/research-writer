# Literature Review Argument Structurer (Phase 3)

This skill converts a **theme-centric literature synthesis matrix** into a **logical argument structure and review outline**, suitable for academic, policy, or R&D research writing.

This phase focuses on **reasoning and organization**, not prose generation.

---

## 1. Trigger
Activate this skill when the user:
- Has completed a literature synthesis matrix (Phase 2), and
- Requests an outline, structure, or argument flow for a literature review.

---

## 2. Pre-Execution Validation

**Before beginning argument structuring, validate prerequisites:**

### 2.1 Verify Synthesis Matrix Files

**Required file:**
- `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` (generated by Phase 2)

**Optional file:**
- `outputs/literature-extraction-matrix.md` (may be consulted for additional context)

**Validation steps:**
1. Check that `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` exists
2. Verify the file is non-empty (contains actual synthesis data, not just headers)
3. Confirm the file contains identifiable themes and evidence patterns

**If synthesis matrix is invalid:**
- **Missing file:** Halt and prompt: "The synthesis matrix file `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` was not found. Please complete Phase 2 (Literature Extraction & Synthesis) first."
- **Empty file:** Halt and prompt: "The synthesis matrix appears to be empty. Please ensure Phase 2 completed successfully and generated valid synthesis data."
- **Malformed structure:** Warn: "The synthesis matrix structure appears incomplete. Proceeding with best-effort analysis, but output quality may be reduced."

### 2.2 Prepare Output Directory
1. Verify `outputs/` directory exists (should exist from Phase 2)
2. If missing, create `outputs/` directory
3. Check for existing `literature-review-outline.md` and note if updating or creating fresh

### 2.3 Verify Phase 2 Completion
1. Confirm Phase 2 outputs are present (both extraction and synthesis matrices)
2. If only extraction matrix exists, halt: "Synthesis matrix required. Phase 2 appears incomplete - only extraction matrix found."

---

## 3. Objective
Produce a **clear, evidence-grounded argument spine** that:
- Organizes themes into a logical sequence
- Distinguishes consensus, debate, and gaps
- Supports traceable, defensible writing in later phases

---

## 4. Input
Markdown files containing the **Literature Synthesis Matrix** generated in Phase 2.
- `outputs/literature-extraction-matrix.md`
- `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md`

No new sources may be introduced.

---

## 5. Execution Model

This skill operates as a **single-pass analytical workflow**:

### 5.1 Processing Strategy

**Single-Pass Operation:**
- Read synthesis matrix once into context
- Perform thematic analysis and clustering
- Generate outline structure
- Write output file

**No Incremental Processing:**
- Unlike Phase 1 and Phase 2, this skill does not process items one-at-a-time
- The synthesis matrix is analyzed holistically
- Suitable for synthesis matrices up to ~50 themes (typical corpus output)

**State Management:**
- No progress tracking required (single-pass operation)
- If interrupted, restart from beginning (typical execution < 5 minutes)
- No recovery mechanism needed

### 5.2 Dependency Chain

**Sequential dependency:**
1. Phase 2 must complete successfully
2. Synthesis matrix must contain analyzable themes
3. This phase produces outline for Phase 4 (drafting)

**Quality propagation:**
- Output quality depends on synthesis matrix quality
- Weak synthesis → weak outline structure
- Agent cannot compensate for Phase 2 gaps

---

## 6. Execution Steps

### 6.1 Theme Clustering
- Review all themes and analytical dimensions in the synthesis matrix.
- Group related themes into **3–7 higher-level clusters**, depending on corpus size.
- Ensure clusters are:
  - Conceptually coherent
  - Mutually distinguishable

---

### 6.2 Argument Sequencing
Arrange clusters into a **logical narrative flow**, such as:
- Foundational → applied → emerging
- Consensus → divergence → unresolved gaps
- Historical → methodological → forward-looking

The sequence must be justified by the evidence distribution.

---

### 6.3 Section-Level Claim Formulation
For each cluster:
- Formulate a **section claim** (1–2 sentences) that summarizes what the literature establishes.
- Explicitly indicate:
  - Areas of agreement
  - Areas of disagreement
  - Strength of evidence

---

### 6.4 Evidence Strength Annotation
For each section, assign an evidence strength label:
- **Strong consensus**
- **Mixed / contested**
- **Emerging / limited**
- **Sparse or absent**

Base this solely on synthesis matrix content.

---

### 6.5 Gap Consolidation
- Identify cross-cutting gaps that:
  - Appear across multiple themes, or
  - Systematically affect the literature (e.g., data limitations, population bias).
- Flag these for later discussion or future research framing.

---

## 7. Output Structure

Save the result as: `outputs/literature-review-outline.md`

The output must include:

### 7.1 Review Outline
```markdown
## Literature Review Outline

### Section 1: [Section Title]
**Core Claim:** …
**Evidence Profile:** …
**Key Themes Covered:** …

### Section 2: …
```

---

### 7.2 Argument Flow Summary
A short paragraph explaining:
- Why sections are ordered as they are
- How the argument progresses logically

### 7.3 Consolidated Gaps & Tensions
A bullet list summarizing:
- Major unresolved issues
- Methodological or conceptual blind spots

### 7.4 Concrete Example Output

```markdown
## Literature Review Outline

### Section 1: Theoretical Foundations of AI Adoption
**Core Claim:** The literature establishes three dominant theoretical frameworks (TAM, DOI, TOE) as primary lenses for understanding AI adoption, with strong consensus on their complementary nature.
**Evidence Profile:** Strong consensus (15 of 18 papers)
**Key Themes Covered:** Technology acceptance models, diffusion theory, organizational readiness

### Section 2: Empirical Evidence on Adoption Drivers
**Core Claim:** Empirical studies consistently identify perceived usefulness and organizational culture as primary drivers, though measurement approaches vary significantly.
**Evidence Profile:** Mixed / contested (operationalization differs across studies)
**Key Themes Covered:** Perceived benefits, organizational factors, technical infrastructure

### Section 3: Barriers and Resistance Patterns
**Core Claim:** The literature identifies technical, organizational, and human barriers, with emerging recognition of ethical concerns as a fourth category.
**Evidence Profile:** Emerging / limited (ethical barriers only in post-2023 studies)
**Key Themes Covered:** Implementation challenges, resistance factors, ethical considerations

## Argument Flow Summary
This review progresses from theoretical foundations (Section 1) to empirical validation (Section 2) to implementation challenges (Section 3). This sequence mirrors the research lifecycle and enables readers to understand both the conceptual basis and practical realities of AI adoption. The structure highlights areas of theoretical consensus while foregrounding empirical inconsistencies that require methodological attention.

## Consolidated Gaps & Tensions
- **Measurement inconsistency:** No standardized instruments for "organizational readiness" across studies
- **Geographic bias:** 12 of 18 studies focus on North America/Europe; limited evidence from Global South
- **Temporal lag:** Most empirical data pre-dates GPT-era AI (2020-2022); relevance to current AI landscape uncertain
- **Ethical framework absence:** Only 3 papers explicitly address ethical implications; gap between adoption pace and ethical guidance
```

---

## 8. Constraints
- Do not generate full prose paragraphs.
- Do not summarize individual papers.
- Do not introduce new interpretations unsupported by the synthesis matrix.
- Avoid normative or persuasive language; remain analytical.

## 9. Error Handling

### 9.1 Missing or Invalid Input Files

**If synthesis matrix file is missing:**
- Halt execution
- Prompt: "Required file `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` not found. Please complete Phase 2 (Literature Extraction & Synthesis) before running Phase 3."

**If synthesis matrix is empty or malformed:**
- Warn: "Synthesis matrix appears incomplete or malformed. Proceeding with best-effort analysis, but outline quality may be reduced."
- Attempt to extract any identifiable themes
- Flag low-confidence sections in output

### 9.2 Insufficient Theme Data

**If synthesis matrix contains <3 themes:**
- Warn: "Synthesis matrix contains insufficient themes for meaningful clustering (found [N], recommended ≥3)."
- Proceed but note limitation in outline: "Note: Limited theme coverage may indicate incomplete synthesis."

**If themes lack evidence annotations:**
- Flag affected sections: "Evidence strength unknown - synthesis matrix incomplete"
- Continue with structural analysis only

### 9.3 Clustering Challenges

**If themes cannot be meaningfully clustered:**
- Provide flat structure (no clustering)
- Note: "Themes appear orthogonal; presenting as sequential sections without hierarchical clustering."

**If multiple valid clustering schemes exist:**
- Choose most evidence-aligned structure
- Document rationale in Argument Flow Summary
- Flag alternative structures if significantly different

### 9.4 Output Write Failures

**If unable to write to `outputs/` directory:**
- Halt and report: "Cannot write to `outputs/` directory. Verify write permissions."
- Return outline structure in response text as fallback

### 9.5 Quality Assurance

**After generating outline, verify:**
- Each section has a core claim statement
- Each section has evidence profile annotation
- Argument flow summary is present
- Gaps section identifies at least 1 limitation (or explicitly states "No major gaps identified")

**If quality checks fail:**
- Flag incomplete sections: "⚠️ Section [N] missing [field]"
- Provide partial output with explicit warnings

---

## 10. Output Validation

**Before finalizing, validate outline meets quality criteria:**

✅ **Structural completeness:**
- 3-7 sections (adjust for corpus size)
- Each section has: title, core claim, evidence profile, key themes

✅ **Evidence grounding:**
- All claims traceable to synthesis matrix
- Evidence strength labels applied consistently
- No unsupported inferences

✅ **Logical coherence:**
- Section sequence is justified
- Argument flow summary explains progression
- Gaps and tensions are consolidated (not scattered)

✅ **Actionability:**
- Outline provides clear structure for drafting
- Each section scope is well-defined
- Transitions between sections are implicit from claims

**Quality Tiers:**
- **Excellent:** All criteria met, clear narrative arc, synthesis gaps well-articulated
- **Good:** Criteria met, minor gaps in justification or evidence annotation
- **Acceptable:** Core structure present, some missing annotations, defensible with edits
- **Poor:** Significant gaps, unclear sequence, requires major revision

Include quality self-assessment in output metadata.

## 12. Integration with Other Phases

### 12.1 Relationship to Phase 2 (Literature Extraction & Synthesis)

**Prerequisites from Phase 2:**
- `outputs/literature-synthesis-matrix.md` must exist and contain valid synthesis data
- Synthesis matrix should identify themes, patterns, contradictions, and gaps
- Ideally, synthesis matrix includes evidence strength indicators

**Quality Dependency:**
- Outline quality directly depends on synthesis quality
- Weak synthesis → weak argument structure
- Missing theme data → limited clustering options

**Input Validation:**
- Phase 3 validates Phase 2 outputs before proceeding
- If synthesis is incomplete, Phase 3 flags issues but attempts best-effort processing

### 12.2 Handoff to Phase 4 (Drafting / Writing)

**Phase 3 outputs serve as inputs to Phase 4:**
- Outline provides section structure and sequence
- Core claims guide paragraph development
- Evidence profiles inform citation strategies
- Gaps and tensions highlight areas needing careful treatment

**Workflow continuity:**
1. Phase 1: Screen corpus → approved PDFs in `corpus/`
2. Phase 2: Extract & synthesize → matrices in `outputs/`
3. Phase 3: Structure argument → outline in `outputs/`
4. Phase 4: Draft prose → literature review document

**Note:** Phase 4 (drafting) is currently outside the scope of this skill set but is the natural next step in the workflow.

---

## 13. Intended Use

This skill supports:
- Academic literature reviews
- Systematic and scoping reviews
- Policy and evidence synthesis reports
- AI-assisted research writing pipelines

It is designed to ensure that drafting in later phases is guided by structure, not intuition.
